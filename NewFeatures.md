# Mass Adding or Batch Adding #
This is the name given to technique in which question - answer pairs are not typed, but added in a bulk quantity. This may be done if the question answer pairs mutually have question TAB answer ENTER question TAB .... this relation. This is already available in MS excel sheets. just select the columns in MS Excel , right click & copy ,now open revision program ,  go to add menu (use arrow keys or hit [a](a.md) ), right click anywhere on the console window and click paste . When it reads all data pasted on it, it will stop . You can press ESC button to stop adding more data & save file.

In this case, when it reads the data copy in clipboard, paste command will act as a user, inputting data at extremely high speed. It will look like the program has gone mad. All data which had to be added will visible on the window, but line by line.

Music is disabled for such purposes. This is because most of the machine cannot handle the music commands at such a high speed. As soon as it reads the data pasted over it, the console window will relax and come to its normal interactive mode.


The new features are as follows :-

Formatted tables
Audio sounds at each step
Auto grading system(based on the time taken )(& length of question & reading speed)
