## How to Add flash cards made by others? ##
There is a very nice website of flashcards http://www.Quizlet.com , it has a huge collection of flashcards made by its users all over the globe. No need to log-in, just search the topic you want flashcards for, click the results of your choice , click the "Export" button just above the list of flashcards . another web-page will open, with all the data in a box (named "Data") below another box named "Options". In this "Options" box, click the radio button in front of "Tab" and "New Line" (already selected by default) . Now just select all the text inside the "Data" box (click "Select All" for ease) and right click on it & copy.

Now open the file you want to add this text into with Revision Program, goto "Add Data" and right click with mouse and select "paste" . All the data is appended into the file. Click one more enter to toggle to next question and press "ESC" . DONE :)

You can also hang around in quizlet.com . Revision program and quizlet both use same basic strategy of "Examination" for "Memorization" . In India, it is said that what is not tested is forgotten . Tested in any sense, even a remembering back an old joke is a test for brain.

### Special character do not work ###
Sorry for the inconvenience caused, but I cant support much fonts, moreover it cant be displayed on a windows command prompt. I am trying to fix it but try to replace Omega symbol with the word Omega & square root symbol with the word 2\_root()

## I dont think I can revise flashcards which I did not learn ??? ##
NO!! (Please excuse me :-) Actually revision program 0.25 and later version takes care of this. If you added flashcards before learning, they can be learned while revising others. Revision Program will ask a badly responded question just after next few questions. If you add a question like this, don't feel bad to press zero in the grade . The question will come up again soon, and you won't forget the answer is such a small time. It will continue doing so up-till it is confident about your memory. There is nothing to worry about this.
Questions are send to repeat in the same session only when the grade is 0,1,2 . Other question are send to come again in later sessions.


## This card it just too easy , I want to decrease its frequency ##
For too easy or obvious questions, just press '+' in grade. Their level will be blown up and they will become less frequent .

## This flash card is bad, delete it ##
Just press 'Del' button when grade is prompted . (del is taken pressed even is Num-Lock is on). This will disable it from tests, but not delete it. To permanently delete, edit the mind file with a notepad, and delete yourself . (look for the question with '-1' at the right end.)

## This card is boring, I wanna learn it later ##
Press '-' (minus) when grade is prompted. It will make the card delay for some sessions.

## Arrow keys on the numpad do not work ##
Actually, its a quite common mistake to leave the Num-Lock off. Some time or the other, it is not sure whether is this button '3' or Page-down. So I switched on NumLock permanently from within the program. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you know c programming, you can edit the source code to fix it your way.
